# Welcome to the Team!

When someone joins the team as a Software Developer the following tasks will need to be completed.  After completing these tasks you will know the secret handshake.

1) Install the most recent version of [Android Studio] (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)  This will be used to write the code for our robot.

2) Install [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) This will be used to get the teamâ€™s most recent software code for the robot.  Updating of the software code will also be done with this program.







Education: 

1) Java, only the basics ( not javascript, similar name but very different programming language)
2) [Github] (https://www.kidscodecs.com/github-tutorials/)
